# 🧠 Object Detection with Faster R-CNN on Pascal VOC

This repository contains a PyTorch-based implementation of an object detection pipeline using a pre-trained **Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 FPN** backbone, trained and evaluated on the **Pascal VOC 2007** dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Build an object detection model using a pre-trained CNN backbone.
- Train and evaluate it on a standard dataset.
- Explore AI-assisted development and report on the experience.

## 🛠️ Features

- Custom dataset wrapper for Pascal VOC 2007
- Use of `torchvision`'s `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn` model
- Training loop with optimizer setup
- Evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and simple mAP
- Visualization of predictions using bounding boxes and labels
- AI-assisted debugging and refactoring
